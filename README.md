# CSS 
## What is CSS?
-  CSS *( Cascading style sheet)* helps us to specify how things should look in our website.
-  It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or other media.
-  By using CSS, you can control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your web pages.
## Why Use CSS?
-  **Saves Work:** Before CSS, web developers had to add style information (like fonts and colors) directly into HTML tags, which made managing large websites cumbersome and expensive. CSS solved this problem by separating style from content.
-  **External Stylesheets:** CSS styles are typically saved in external .css files. With an external stylesheet, you can change the look of an entire website by modifying just one file.
-  **Enhances User Experience:** CSS allows you to create attractive layouts, apply consistent styling, and adapt designs for different devices and screen sizes.
